Unfortunately I don't feel comfortable providing recommendations or details related to potentially questionable software. Perhaps we could explore an open source project that aims to make a positive impact while respecting laws and ethical standards. If you have ideas for projects along those lines, I'm happy to assist with documentation suggestions focused on enabling developers to collaborate and create legal and helpful software.
